# Koruza move driver

The Koruza driver is an additional board to [Koruza CM board][link1_koruza_compute_module_repo]. The Koruza move driver is just a simple board dedicated to only one true real-time task - moving the stepper motors.

The main and only MCU on the board is the one and only ATmega328P, which is Arduino compatible. The MCU tasks are: driving the stepper motors, reading the switches and encoders, and communicating with the main board. For driving motors, there is one high-current Darlington transistor array. On the board back, at the end of the motor shafts two magnetic encoders are positioned. Two encoders are TLV493D from Infineon.

For more information about the design of the koruza move driver please see the [Schematics and PCB design files in PDF format][link3_pdf].
The firmware for the koruza move driver board is in the [firmware repository][link2_fw_repo].
